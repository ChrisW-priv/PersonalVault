Perform actions\n3. Plan and coordinate plan execution\n4. Assist communication\n5. Perform exploratory research\n6. Day to day scheduling\n\nWhilst performing those tasks, total discretion and confidentiality is crucial. Assistants often handle sensitive or private information, so trust and confidentiality are critical aspects of the role.\n\nPerhaps most underrated ability of the assistants is the ability to offload the difficult or burdening tasks. One of such tasks is the email answering and external communication.\n\nExploratory research is difficult to define in terms of the actual end goal. I imagine something in the proximity of \"Given some initial direction, an AI starts prompting itself to generate some result and then preforming self evaluation to determine if more research is needed or if it should pivot to different tasks\". This however will not be implemented. In the end it is not to dissimilar to the direct human assist on direct requests.  \n\nWhile for simple tasks it is enough for the LM to provide the simple answer or to perform a task on user behalf, it quickly falls short if user requires assist in more complex tasks where there are intermediate steps needed to achieve end task. This means that the assistant, after understanding the task at hand, needs to make an execution plan and follow it until either the task is complete, or there was an error in which case, the LM needs to take the end task, list of successful tasks and analyze why there was an error.","x":-2640,"y":301,"width":1100,"height":819},

Additionally, when we want to query the LM on some internal documentation or personal notes or other topics where LM could not have been trained we cannot reasonably expect the LM to respond with correct information.\n\nWe need a way to extend the knowledge of the LM to new topics.","x":-4160,"y":1613,"width":880,"height":387},
