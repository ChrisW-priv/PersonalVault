Instantaneous power delivered to a one-port:
$$p(t) = i(t)u(t)$$
If this one-port is an element of [[Alternating current (AC)]] circuit then.
$$i(t) = I_mcos(\omega t+\phi_i)$$
$$u(t) = U_mcos(\omega t+\phi_u)$$

$$p(t) = I_mU_m cos(ωt+φi) cos(ωt+φu) = \frac12 I_mU_m cos(φi − φu) + \frac12 I_mU_m cos(2ωt + φi + φu) $$
> [!Notice]
> Pulsation of the alternating term is twice as big as the pulsation of signals i and u.

Mean power, which, in the context of AC circuits, is also called active power, is the mean value P of the instantaneous power.
