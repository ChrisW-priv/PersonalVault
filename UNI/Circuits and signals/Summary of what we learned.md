Arrow phrases matter! The usual $u = Ri$ is meaningless because when one of the arrows has the opposite direction, the formula is $u = -Ri$.

And here $u=e$
Here $e[V]$ is called electromotive force.

# Current Source

And here $i=j$.
Here $j[A]$ is the generated current

# Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)
Given node like this:

We have to note that: $i_1, i_2, i_3,...,i_n=0$.

# Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

Electric potentials (with respect to any point) of the circuit's nodes are well defined.
The node with respect to which we measure electric potentials is called ground or earth.
