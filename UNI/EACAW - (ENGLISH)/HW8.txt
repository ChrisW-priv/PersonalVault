There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to take into account when considering the
purchase of a hybrid (gasoline-electric) car. Such cars are, for instance, undoubtedly better for the
environment in the sense that they cause less air pollution. Furthermore, the degree to which they
rely on oil, a natural resource which is rapidly becoming depleted, is much less than is the case with
conventional cars, Nevertheless, hybrid cars are not without their problems. Cost may be an issue
as well as the technical complexity of the engine. Provided that you take these factors into account,
there is no reason not to buy a hybrid car.
