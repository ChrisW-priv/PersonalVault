test 1
params:
    file: violin
    sampling freq: 40
    sine freq: 20
    (both in kHz)
    method: ideal
results and thoughts:
    sample signal to wielokrotność tej samej fali
    input signal ma długi, ciągły "ogon"
    reconstructed jest przerwany koło +-badnwidth of the files (20)
    perdiod T = 1/fs = 1/40kHz
    input and reconstructed signals look similar when samplig freq is high but not when we choose lower sampling freq.
    SNRdb = 50 db for input signal
    SNRdb = 35 for reconstructed signal
2. 
    in ideal sampling spectrum sampled signal jest periodic but not in sample and hold,
    reconstructed signal is 10dB higher in sample and hold 
    in ideal sampling, values got back to zero whereas in sample and hold they dont
    in ideal sampling, the spectrum of the sampled signal is a piece of the full 200kHz sample repeated with a period of 1/sample freq. but in sample and hold the spectrum of the sampled signal is the entire 200kHz spectrum (not repeated parts), it is not periodic.

3.
   8kHz for ALL audio files 
    for violin:
        the spectrum of input signal is visible from -20 to 20 kHz with noise further out
        the spectrum of the reconstructed signal is visible from -4 to 4 kHz
        8 kHz is not enough to capture the entire spectrum of input signal wchich results in inacurately recuntructed signal
        SNRdb = 12.7951
    for piano:
        for piano we got the same observations
        SNRdb = 32.0683
    for song:
        same for the song
        SNRdb = 30.4768
    for wideband speech
        same as in violin
        SNRdb = 28.1310
    for narowband speech
        because the input signal spectrum is within the sampling frequency, the reconstucted signals error is minimal
        SNRdb = 40.4582

    why signal quality different?
        because of the different signal spactrum
    why are there distortions
        because intput signal spectrum in not in sampling range

4. 
    ideal sampling, 6kHz sine freq. for ALL sampling frequency
    file : violin

    sampling freq: 100kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal contains some noise because sampling frequency is bigger than the bandwidth of the recording
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 43.64
        frequency = same
    sampling freq: 50kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal contains some noise because sampling frequency is bigger than the bandwidth of the recording
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 37.62
        frequency = same
    sampling freq: 40kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal is the same as the bandwidth of the recording
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 35.68
        frequency = same
    sampling freq: 25kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal is smaller than the bandwidth of the recording, this introduces errors to reconstructed signal
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 31.6
        frequency = not the same (visible differences)
    sampling freq: 20kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal is smaller than the bandwidth of the recording, this introduces errors to reconstructed signal
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 29.66
        frequency = not the same (visible differences)
    sampling freq: 12.5kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal is smaller than the bandwidth of the recording, this introduces errors to reconstructed signal
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 25.58
        frequency = not the same (visible differences)
    sampling freq: 10kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal is smaller than the bandwidth of the recording, this introduces errors to reconstructed signal
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 23.62
        frequency = not the same (visible differences)
    sampling freq: 8kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal is smaller than the bandwidth of the recording, this introduces errors to reconstructed signal
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 21.69
        frequency = not the same (visible differences)
    sampling freq: 5kHz
        spectrum of reconstructed signal is smaller than the bandwidth of the recording, this introduces errors to reconstructed signal
        input SNRdb = 49.66
        reconstructed SNRdb = 17.57
        frequency = not the same (visible differences)
        
    summary:
        frequency of the reconstructed signal is not he same when sampling frequency is lower that sampling frequency of input signal
        when sampling frequency is lower we loose some information to random variations.
