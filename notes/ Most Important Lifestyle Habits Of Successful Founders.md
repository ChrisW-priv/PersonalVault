## Adult Harder

You must be ok with not fitting in to the general society or even your closest
surroundings, because you are aiming for something different than all of them.

## Audit your life

Know how you spend your time:

- sleep
- diet
- exercise

Also: is your environment supporting or diminishing you?

>[!Important]
>If whatever you do succeeds - are you setup to live in that for long? Many ppl
live as they were planning not to succeed.

## Create information bubble

make it such that it supports you not distracts you

## Salary

Make sure you have enough, but leave equity for the upside

## Hard conversations

At some point there will be a conflict, make sure you can resolve it without
burning bridges. Hint: there will be opportunities to resolve the small fights,
use them to learn how to deal with conflict.

## Fight or flight

Make sure you take action carefully: maybe there is an option not to take action
at all? It is almost never a good option to respond to stuff in the heat of
emotions.

## Good R&R

Collect yourself before you react negatively in front of the others. 

    General that pulls his hear out and says "We are all gonna die" is a bad
    general

## Fatal punches

Sometimes you just fail, no other way to say it. Look at the facts and ask
yourself if you are really down. If you are, stop. There are ppl that are built 
to rip you off when you are struggling. 

Also: it is your idea that failed. You are not a failure (necessarily), just analyze 
what went wrong and do better next time.
