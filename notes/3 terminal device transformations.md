## WHAT
Three-terminal devices are crucial components in electronic circuits that can control current or voltage in various configurations. Common examples include transistors, operational amplifiers, and voltage regulators.

### 1. What are three-terminal devices?  
Three-terminal devices are electronic components that have three terminals: input, output, and a control terminal. They enable the manipulation of electrical signals.

### 2. How do transistors work?  
Transistors operate by using a small input current at the control terminal to control a larger current flowing between the input and output terminals, resulting in amplification.

### 3. What is an operational amplifier?  
An operational amplifier is a high-gain voltage amplifier with differential inputs and a single-ended output. It is used for mathematical operations on electrical signals.

### 4. What role do voltage regulators play?  
Voltage regulators maintain a constant output voltage regardless of changes in input voltage or load conditions, ensuring stable power supply for electronic devices.
