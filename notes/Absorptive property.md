Two binary operations, $+$ and $\cdot$, are said to be connected by the absorption law if:

$$x \cdot (y + x) = x + (y \cdot x) = x$$

A set equipped with two commutative and associative binary operations ∨ ("join") and ∧ ("meet") that are connected by the absorption law is called a lattice; in this case, both operations are necessarily idempotent (i.e. $a \lor a = a$ and $a \land a = a$).

Examples of lattices include Heyting algebras and Boolean algebras, in particular sets of sets with union ($\cup$) and intersection ($\cap$) operators, and ordered sets with min and max operations. 

## WHAT the concept is

The absorptive property states that for certain operations, one element can essentially "absorb" another when combined. This can be illustrated through specific mathematical properties.

## HOW to apply it

The absorptive property can be applied in algebraic manipulations. For example, the following equations demonstrate this property:

1. Property 1: $x \cdot (y + x) = x$
2. Property 2: $x + (y \cdot x) = x$

In these identities, the presence of $x$ allows for the simplification of the expression, highlighting the absorptive nature of the operation.
