During my work in Axpo, I had a great pleasure of working with Pawel Pawlucki.
During that time I asked him "If he wanted to learn the energy market, how would he do it?"

Answer was to learn the market through 2 view that are linked, and influence
each other, but are separate in practice. Those views are: **financial** and **physical**.
That is because the trading and delivery is separate.

In the financial view, to analize it through:

- Business
- Financing
- Credit Risk
- Commodity Market in General
- Types of contracts
- Specially important are additional clauses in contracts signed

Law regarding the separation of responsibilities.
