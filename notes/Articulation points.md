## Definition

In [Graph](Graph.md) theory, articulation points are nodes whose removal causes
an increase in the number of connected components, meaning they create two or
more disconnected graphs.

## Question and Answer

**Q: What are articulation points?**  
A: Articulation points are critical nodes in a graph that, when removed, result in a greater number of disconnected components.

**Q: How are articulation points similar to bridges?**  
A: Both articulation points and bridges, which are edges whose removal increases the number of connected components, are critical for maintaining the connectivity of a graph.
