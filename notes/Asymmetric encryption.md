## Definition

Asymmetric encryption is a method of encryption where it is practically impossible to deduce the [Decryption Key](Decryption%20Key) from the [Encryption Key](Encryption%20Key). It utilizes a pair of keys: a public key, which can be shared openly, and a private key, which is kept secret.

## Intuition

Also known as a system with a public key, this method eliminates the need for mutual trust between parties and allows for secure communication. The major challenge lies in maintaining an accurate mapping of key-owner pairs within the system. Additionally, it is essential to know the recipient's identity to obtain their public key before sending encrypted messages. 

## Q&A Structure

**Q: What is asymmetric encryption?**  
A: It is an encryption method that employs a pair of keys for secure communication, making it infeasible to derive the private key from the public key.

**Q: What are the advantages of using asymmetric encryption?**  
A: It provides enhanced security by allowing users to share a public key while keeping their private key confidential, enabling secure communication without prior arrangement.

**Q: What are the challenges associated with asymmetric encryption?**  
A: The key challenges include ensuring accurate mapping of key owners and the necessity of verifying the recipient's identity to use their public key.
