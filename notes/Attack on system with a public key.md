## What is the Concept?

In asymmetric encryption, the system relies on a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Attackers may aim to deduce the decryption key based on the public encryption key.

## Q&A Structure

**Q: What is a public key?**  
A: A public key is a cryptographic key that can be shared openly and is used to encrypt data.

**Q: Why can brute-force attacks be unfeasible?**  
A: Brute-force attacks are often infeasible because the size of the keys used in asymmetric encryption is typically very large, making comprehensive searches impractical.

**Q: How do attackers approach breaking asymmetric encryption?**  
A: Instead of brute-forcing the keys, attackers often target the underlying principles of how the key was generated, such as exploiting weaknesses in the algorithms used.

## Intuition

In the case of the RSA algorithm, for example, attackers may attempt prime number decomposition. If they can factor the product of two large prime numbers quickly enough, they can break many RSA standards. This method of decomposition is fundamental to the security of RSA, and its failure can lead to the exposure of the entire encryption system. 

Understanding these principles is crucial for evaluating the security of public key infrastructures and developing stronger cryptographic systems.
