## Q&A Structure

**Q: What is a basis of a vector space?**  
A: A basis is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the vector space.

**Q: Why is it important for vectors to be linearly independent?**  
A: Linearly independent vectors ensure that no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others, thus providing a unique representation of vectors in the space.

**Q: What does it mean for vectors to span a space?**  
A: To span a space means that any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis.
