## Definition

The Bayes factor is a ratio of two competing statistical models. It does so by compering how much more likely you are to see an event given two different hypothesis. It can be seen as part of [Proportional form of Bayes Rule](Proportional%20form%20of%20Bayes%20Rule.md) in [Comparing two hypothesis given data](Comparing%20two%20hypothesis%20given%20data.md).

## Notation

$$K = \frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D|H_2)}$$

- $K$ is a Bayes factor
- $P(D|H_1)$ is a probability of seeing data given hypothesis 1
- $P(D|H_2)$ is a probability of seeing data given hypothesis 2

## Intuition

The Bayes factor is a part of
