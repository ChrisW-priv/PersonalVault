## Definition

The Bayes factor is a ratio of two competing statistical models. It measures how much more likely an event is under one hypothesis compared to another. This concept is integral to the [Proportional form of Bayes Rule](Proportional%20form%20of%20Bayes%20Rule.md) and is useful when [Comparing two hypotheses given data](Comparing%20two%20hypothesis%20given%20data.md).

## Notation

The Bayes factor is denoted as follows:

$$K = \frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D|H_2)}$$

- $K$ is the Bayes factor, indicating the strength of evidence for one hypothesis over another.
- $P(D|H_1)$ represents the probability of observing the data $D$ given hypothesis $H_1$.
- $P(D|H_2)$ represents the probability of observing the data $D$ given hypothesis $H_2$.

## Intuition

The Bayes factor quantifies the evidence provided by the data in favor of one hypothesis over another, helping researchers make informed decisions based on their statistical models.
