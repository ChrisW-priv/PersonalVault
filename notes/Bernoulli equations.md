## Definition

Bernoulli equations are defined by the form:

$$y + P(x)y' = Q(x)\cdot y^n$$

Where:

- $y$ is the dependent variable.
- $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are functions of the independent variable $x$.
- $n$ is a constant.

## Feynman Method: Q&A Structure

**Q1: What is the first step in solving a Bernoulli equation?**

**A1:** The first step is to find an integrating factor defined by the formula:

$$I(x) = e^{\int (1-n)P(x)dx}$$

**Q2: What comes after calculating the integrating factor?**

**A2:** After calculating the integrating factor, you can solve the equation as follows:

$$y^{1-n} = \frac1{I(x)}\left[\int (1-n)Q(x)I(x) dx \right]$$

## Changing Any Function into Standard Form

To convert a general function into standard form, start with the equation:

$$F\cdot dx + G\cdot dy = 0$$

1. First, divide everything by $dx$:

$$F + Gy' = 0$$

2. Then divide everything by $G$:

$$y' + \frac{F}{G} = 0$$

3. Finally, split $\frac{F}{G}$ to obtain the standard Bernoulli form:

$$y + P(x)y' = Q(x)\cdot y^n$$
