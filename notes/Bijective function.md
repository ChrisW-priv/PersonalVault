## Overview

A bijective function is a function that establishes a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) between a set of elements in the domain and a set of elements in the co-domain.

## Key Concepts

### Definition

A function is called bijective if:

- Every element of the domain set is connected to exactly one element of the co-domain set.
- Every element of the co-domain set is connected to exactly one element of the domain set.

Thus, for a function $f: A \to B$ to be bijective, it must be both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

### Inverse Function

In the context of bijective functions, there exists an inverse function $f^{-1}: B \to A$, which means that for every element in set B, there is a corresponding element in set A.

## Q&A Structure

**Q: What is a bijective function?**  
A: A bijective function is a function where each element in the domain corresponds uniquely to an element in the co-domain and vice versa.

**Q: Can a bijective function have an inverse?**  
A: Yes, a bijective function always has an inverse function.

**Q: How can I determine if a function is bijective?**  
A: To determine if a function is bijective, check if it is both injective and surjective.
