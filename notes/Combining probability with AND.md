[Probability](Probability.md)

## Definition

We use AND logic operator when we want to know what is the probability of two (or more) events happening.

## Notation

If we have two events $A,B$ then probability of BOTH of them happening will be noted as $P(A,B)$.

We can calculate it by multiplying the probabilities of both $P(A,B) = P(A) \times P(B)$

## Intuition

Rather simple, however best description would likely be to draw a tree of possible outcomes for each event and just trace how many outcomes are at the end that satisfied both $A$ and $B$.
