- No company ever works without it selling *something*.
- Focusing on sales will often be done at the cost of robust operations.
    - Non scale-able operation departments will rug pull entire company.
    - Being data driven + event based early enables the company to scale easily.
        - Data catalogue is critical to the success.
- With limited amount of time and effort, we have to outsource some operations to other companies.
    - Never outsource core of the business.
    - If it is not core - outsource to some company.
- Permission system must be implemented, but should not impede operations. 
    - There needs to be an easy way to request access to the resource.
        - This means knowing what even is accessible must be easy.
- don't forget the perspective of legal and finance (taxes plus cash-flow)
