title: Create local network
---

To create a local network, you will need a router that supports the creation of a local network. Most modern routers have this capability built in, and the process for setting up a local network will vary depending on the specific model of router you are using.

Generally, the steps for creating a local network are as follows:

1.  Connect your router to your internet modem, and ensure that your internet connection is working.
2.  Access the router's configuration page, which is typically done by opening a web browser and entering the router's IP address in the address bar.
3.  Look for the network settings or wireless settings page on the router's configuration page, and find the option to create a new wireless network (also known as a Wi-Fi network).
4.  Enter a name for your wireless network (also known as the SSID) and a password to secure the network.
5.  Save your changes and wait for the router to apply the new settings.

Once the local network has been created, you should be able to see the wireless network on any device with Wi-Fi capabilities, such as a laptop, smartphone, or tablet. You can connect to the network by entering the network name and password on your device. Once connected, you should be able to access the internet and any other devices on the local network.

> [!Note] 
> Creating a local network does not automatically allow devices on the network to access each other's files or resources. In order to share files and other resources on the network, you will need to set up a [server](Creating%20local%20server.md) and configure the appropriate sharing settings on your devices.
