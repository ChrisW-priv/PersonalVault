Focus on micro-nutrients -> fill the rest with macros + optimize the release of hormones like testosterone, Growth Hormone + IGF-1 (to improve recovery)

## Micro


## Testosterone

Is built from cholesterol and high fat diet causes the release of it too.

So eggs, and avocados are good, cuz cholesterol.

You need Mg and Zn, so:
- dark chocolate, nuts and legumes, carrots, berries, boiled spinach, potatoes,
- shellfish and meat (Zn)

Vit. D helps; low carb diet improves the production of testosterone too

So food summary:

- meat + eggs
- berries 
- orange
- boiled spinach (or other leafy green)
- raw carrot
- onion + garlic
- potatoes/rice
- almonds
- salt

Also once a week: liver
2/3x a week a fatty fish like salmon, makrel, sardines

Also exercise (full body) and competition + cold exposure

## Growth Hormone

Is released during sleep. It is of *critical* importance to **get good sleep.

Triggers that stimulate creation of GH:

- Hunger (Fasting)
- Low Energy States (insulin is an inhibitor of GH production)
- Intense exercise
- High levels of dopamine and serotonin (indirectly by reducing the inhibitors)

Setup to maximize: 

- Sleep **before 11PM**
    - Bedroom: cool, silent, dark
    - Do not eat before bed (4 hours before) (to limit the insulin)
- Exercise
    - High volume, high intensity (3-6 sets, 8 reps+, short rest)
    - Activate as much muscles as possible
    - Sprints work well too (Sprint 8)
    - 3-4 days of lifts, 2-3 max intensity cardio
    - Sauna also works
