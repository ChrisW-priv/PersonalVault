title: Differential equations
---

Differential equations arise when it's easier to describe change rather that absolute amounts. For example system of 3 bodies in space pulled by gravitational forces is such system.

We divide systems of differential equations into:

- [Ordinary Differential Equations](Ordinary%20Differential%20Equations) (ODE) - finite number of values changing with time.  [Examples of ODEs](Examples%20of%20ODEs.md)
- [Partial Differential Equations](Partial%20Differential%20Equations) (PDE) - deals with continuum of values (velocity of fluid in any given place or spread of heat in some physical body).  [Examples of PDEs](Examples%20of%20PDEs.md)

## Higher order differential equations

We note equation of n-th order based on the higest order of derivative in the equation.

Example: $y'' - 6y' + 9y = 0$ is a second order differential equation.

## Solutions of differential equations

**General solution** of n-th order differential equation is a family of functions dependent on n constants.
**The particular solution** is a function which satisfies the differentail equation. 

## Solving differential equations

There is large number of methods to solve differential equations. Mainly we can solve ODEs in an analitical way and PDEs in numerical way

Methods to solve ODEs:

1.  [Separation of Variables](Separation%20of%20Variables.md)
2.  [Homogenous equations](Homogenous%20equations.md)
3.  [Linear differential equations](Linear%20differential%20equations.md)
4.  [Bernoulli equations](Bernoulli%20equations.md)
5.  [Exact method](Exact%20method%20for%20solving%20ODEs.md) with [integrating factor](Integrating%20factor%20for%20exact%20method.md)
