> [!Definition]
A nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that [Linear transformation](Linear%20transformation.md) is applied to it. The corresponding [Eigenvalue](Eigenvalue.md), often denoted by $\lambda$ , is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.

> [!Warning]
Not every linear transformation has eigenvectors or enough vectors to describe original system of coordinates fully!

## Notation

Every eigenvector must satisfy the equation:

$$A\cdot \vec{v} = \lambda \cdot \vec{v}$$

Where $A$ is a matrix describing transformation, $\vec{v}$ is an eigenvector and $\lambda$ is it's eigenvalue.

## Calculation

We start with the calculation of [eigenvalue](Eigenvalue.md#Calculation).

Then, we solve the [System of linear equations](System%20of%20linear%20equations.md) for given data.
