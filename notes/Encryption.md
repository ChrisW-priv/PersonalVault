## Definition

Way of encoding an information in a way that prevent unauthorized people from access its content.

Examples include:

- file encryption on local machine 
- message encryption in between peers across media like internet

## Notation

To denote encryption of message $M_{1}$ using key $k_{1}$ we write

$$E_{k_{1}}(M_{1})$$

## Intuition

> [!Warning]
> Remember that the use of encryption has to be motivated in some way. If there is no real benefit to using encryption then we add overhead to the process in question.
