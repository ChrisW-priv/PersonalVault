---

## Definition

An Eulerian circuit is an [Eulerian Path](Eulerian%20Path.md) which starts and ends on the same vertex.

## Notation

[Counting the number of in and out edges in a graph](Counting%20the%20number%20of%20in%20and%20out%20edges%20in%20a%20graph.md)

### Undirected Graph

Every vertex has an even degree

### Directed Graph

Every vertex has equal indegree and outdegree

## Intuition
