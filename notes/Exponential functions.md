Exponential function is a function that takes in a constant number and returns a certain power of that of that function.

A constant to the power x can be noted as $\mathbb{c}^x$ and be made a function $f(x) = \mathbb{c}^x$

The most fundamental and special exponential function is $e^x$, where $\mathbb{c}$ in $\mathbb{c}^x$ was substituted with [number e](Number%20e.md).
