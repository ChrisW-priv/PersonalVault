The [Relation in Mathematics](Relation%20in%20Mathematics.md) and [Function in Mathematics](Function%20in%20Mathematics.md) both are different concepts. 

All the functions are relations, but the relation cannot be function.

The relation and function have the main difference, i.e., **a relation is able to generate many outputs for at least one input**, but in the case of function, it can only generate one output for every input. This factor is very basic to differentiate between them.
