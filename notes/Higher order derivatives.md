title: Higher order derivatives
---

[Derivative](Derivative.md)

## Higher order derivatives

Higher order derivatives are often referred to as "derivative of the

derivative". Note: there is no limit to how "deep" we can go, however we will at

some point hit either a point where consecutive derivatives form a loop.

Sometimes that loop is one constant like 0 or $e^x$ but it can also be $sin(x)$.

### Notation

For an order of derivative $n$ of single input function $f$ we note it as $\frac{d^nf}{dx^n}(x)$.
