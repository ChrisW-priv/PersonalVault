## Higher order derivatives

> [!Note]
> There is no limit to how "deep" we can go, however we will at some point hit a
point where consecutive derivatives form a loop. Sometimes that loop is one
constant like 0 or $e^x$ but it can also be $sin(x)$.

### Notation

For an order of derivative $n$ of single input function $f$ we note it as

$$
\frac{d^nf}{dx^n}(x)
$$
