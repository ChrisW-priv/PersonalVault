Calculation of Annual Revenue from IT Projects

### 1. Automation and Labor Time Savings

Example:

* 4 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) × 10,000 PLN/month = 40,000 PLN/month
* Annualized: **480,000 PLN/year**

### 2. Reduced IT System Maintenance Costs

Example:

* Decommissioning a system saves 1 full-time position (20,000 PLN/month)
* Plus 100 hours × 100 PLN = 10,000 PLN
* Monthly savings: 30,000 PLN
* Annualized: **360,000 PLN/year**

### 3. Improved IT Team Productivity**

Example:

* 20% time savings on team cost of 1,000,000 PLN
* Annual savings: **200,000 PLN/year**

### 4. Infrastructure Savings (e.g., Cloud Migration)**

Example:

* Cost reduction from 1,000,000 PLN (local) to 700,000 PLN (cloud)
* Annual savings: **300,000 PLN/year**

### 5. Reduced Risk of Failures or Downtime**

Example:

* Reducing incidents from 5 to 2
* Each incident costs 50,000 PLN
* Annual savings: **150,000 PLN/year**
