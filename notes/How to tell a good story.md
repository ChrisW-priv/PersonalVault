Structure:

1. Setup/exhibition -> introduce all main actors to "the stage"
2. Conflict/Climax
3. Resolution

To create the suspense: create open loops.
You build that with questions for example:

1. How did I get here?
2. So what happened next?

Practice:

1. Location
2. Living things
3. Inanimate objects
4. Emotions/feelings, specially physical feelings

Delivery

1. Pitch 
2. Pace
3. Pause
4. Posture
5. Power (emphasis)
