> [!Definition]
> Impedance is a measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to the flow of alternating current (AC). It is a complex quantity, meaning that it has both magnitude and phase, and is typically denoted by the symbol "$Z$".

The magnitude of impedance is related to the resistance of the circuit, while the phase is related to the reactance of the circuit. Impedance is important in electronic circuits because it determines the amount of current that will flow through the circuit, and thus the amount of power that can be delivered to a load. Impedance is typically measured in ohms, and is often used in conjunction with admittance (the reciprocal of impedance) to analyse and design AC circuits

Every source less linear one-port which is an element of an AC circuit can be described with its impedance $Z$, which usually depends on pulsation $\omega$. According to Ohm's law, there is a relationship $U=ZI$ where $U$ is voltage [Phasor](Phasor.md) and $I$ is current [Phasor](Phasor.md)
