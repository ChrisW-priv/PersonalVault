## CRAM as early as possible

> If you will study just before an exam, just do the same 2 week earlier.

## Don't create learning debt

If you study by making notes and writing flashcards, then notice that all you do

is create work for future self to review them. If you don't review them, then

why make the notes in the first place?

There is a really low ceiling for this this approach. There is only so much time

in a day.

> Focus on clearing the work for future self

When studying, employ techniques that make you learn the topic immediately,

only **make note** for revision and **to improve mastery** over a topic.

## Study More Then Study Less

Basically the logic goes like this: If you are not studying, then it makes no 

difference if your techniques are efficient or not: you will get little progress.

However, once you get to the point that you can comfortably say that you

are putting in enough **effort**, then and only then, the switch to

**efficiency** makes sense. 

## Study Less Then Study More

Opposite to the prev. point but the idea is: leave some time to optimize the 

process. Do not study full tilt, as that leaves no time for improvement.

## Plug the leak

> If you have a boat that has a leak.
> Do not bucket out the water.
> Fix the leak first.
> Then clear the backlog

## Making learning hard

The common misconception is that if the study is hard, then it is ineffective. 

This is not true. **Active thinking is hard by design**, but is the only way to 

effectively learn new material. 

## Make hard stuff easy

If the tasks that you need to do seem daunting, then starting them is 

unappealing.

## Build a learning system

He goes on to roast my system ("not much of a system at all") and goes on 

to describe system features required to make studying effective. 

Basically the [Perrio System](Perrio%20System.md).

## Start simple build slow

We are used to doing things one way, fixing all things in the same time will 

not not work (he promised)

> If you have 10 things to fix, fix one and be done.
> Then you only have 9 things to fix.

## Create a learning log

Creating a log is super useful if you 

Basic steps

- **What** are you trying to improve.
- **Progress** log of thoughts on the goal. Maybe there were setbacks? 
- **Reflection** What went wrong, why?
- **Trends/Habits** log on what we think is recurring.
- **Action** items generation of things to work on/ways to improve.
- **Prioritize** actions: [Pareto Principle](Pareto%20Principle.md) is real and will help you achieve 

## Measure true learning efficiency

It may feel that we are loosing efficiency because we spend more time studying

in total. But the true effect may be that in that time spent, we actually

## Mastery first

> Do not try to be fast or easier until you figured out a way to make it effective
