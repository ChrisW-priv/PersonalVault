## Goal

I want to become a better student. My success criteria is to be able to learn

new topics faster and retain memory of them for longer, as well as build a

stable set of notes that will allow me to reference what I learned later.

## Progress

What happened?

- I made some notes that one can track under #learning 
- I increased my understanding on what makes the learning process faster

## Reflection

### 2025-02-18

So far, I still need to make some notes on the topics. I'd love to be in a place

where I can just reference my notes as "This is how you study". 

But I should also start studying something practical. 

When I do, I should stick to [Perrio System](Perrio%20System.md). This means that I'll have to 

fundamentally adjust the approach to learning... wish me luck

Also, I will almost surely hit a wall when it comes to note-taking. I currently 

have no place to store my notes in a consistent way, as well as *very* limited 

capacity to store the notes that are non-linear.

## Trends

### 2025-02-18

I seem to have gained the traction of the idea that main goal is to **generate

links** between what I already know as well as build and use a learning system.

## Action items

### 2025-02-18

- Find a topic to study.
- During the study I should not focus on the subject but on the process I try
to master.
- Use the [Perrio System](Perrio%20System.md) to make this new system more approachable.
- Make notes on what I learned in a way that maximizes productivity.
