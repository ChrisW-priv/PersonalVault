Quote to remember:

> Studying is not learning! You learn only when you retain what you studied

## Techniques

- Spaced repetition - to combat the forgetting curve
- Self testing - to force ourself to generate new ideas
- Ad. Self test - [Learning Taxonomy](Learning%20Taxonomy.md) should be used to make tests that force you to use highest level of thinking about the topic as soon as possible.
- learning different fields in the same time (??) (interleaving)
- incubation: making a short break to let what you learned sink in
- communities of practice: surround yourself with ppl that know/are learning the same thing
- visual learning: make the use of humans advanced visual cortex. 
- make the same info accessible through diff media. Ex.: color coded bar chart with % on the edge is better than a table. (multimodal learning)
- make the cognitive load high: do not think that because the task is easy then it is good or if the learning process is hard then it doesn't work. On the contrary! if it is painful, probably it'll stick for longer
- make the idea interactive - focus on the ability to test new ideas quickly
