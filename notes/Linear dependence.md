A property of a [Vector](Vector.md). 

Two vectors are linearly dependent if one sits at the [span](Span%20of%20vector%20space.md) of the other. 

Vectors that are linearly dependent are mutually redundant.

### Notation:

If $\vec{u}$ is dependent :

$$ \vec{u} = a * \vec{v} + b * \vec{w}$$

If $\vec{u}$ is independent :

$$ \vec{u} \neq a * \vec{v} + b * \vec{w}$$
