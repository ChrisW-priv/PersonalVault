title: Logic Gates
---

Basic building block of a digital circuit. It's a simple [electronic circuit](electronic%20circuit) that performs a specific logical operation on one or more input signals and produces an output signal based on the inputs. There are several different types of logic gates, each of which performs a different logical operation. 

On the high level they can be treated as a special kind of [Function in Mathematics](Function%20in%20Mathematics.md) operating on basis of [Boolean Algebra](Boolean%20Algebra.md). Logic gates are implementing [boolean](boolean) functions. Logic is done on [binary](binary) input and results in binary output.

## Most common gates

[XOR gate](XOR%20gate.md)

[NOR gate](NOR%20gate.md)

[NOT gate](NOT%20gate.md)

[NAND gate](NAND%20gate.md)

[AND gate](AND%20gate.md)

[OR gate](OR%20gate.md)
