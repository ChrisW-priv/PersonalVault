## Mastery over tools

> I can do without any tools. But the more tools I have, the more effective I am.

If one wants to become master of one's field, one first needs to master all base

components. Meta skills of the field are often overlooked in favor of using the

tools that allow really shallow understanding of the concept. However, just like

basketball players need to first be good athletes, as in: be strong, run fast, have 

good endurance, we too need to understand WHY are using the tools that we 

are using.

That being said. When we are reaching for the top, it will be the tools we use

that differentiate us from the rest. Each meta component of our job should 

be as friction-less as possible. Not only that: If we do something all the time

the execution of that task should be **automatic**. 

## Working hard

One quote I hear all the time is "Work smart not hard". Which to me is a

complete mystery. Why would you not **work smart AND hard**. Now, 

the next point on my list actually kind of disproves that...

Best motto to have is probably

> Work smart THEN hard

Idea is that if you work in a way that is efficient, and your processes have 

no friction, then applying more effort to them will yield extra results.

## Taking time to improve the process

Striking the balance between spending time in order to improve the process

for future productivity vs getting more done by not spending that time is

tricky. Good approach is to periodically review the effects of the actions.
