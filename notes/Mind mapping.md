Thinks to do to engage in effective mind mapping in the following sections:

## Grouping 

Information can often be grouped in many different ways. It is important to decide what way is the one that will help us most in the future and group our knowledge accordingly. 

## Relating

Answer the question: "How are the ideas related to each other in this group?"
## Interconnection

Relating groups to eachother, to avoid islands of knowledge that make our knowledge compartmentalized. 

## Non verbal

Using many words indicates that not too much thought was put in to the note taking and probably the learning as well.

## Direction/flow

When using arrows: what is the way that the information is related? How one thing impacting the next

## Emphasis 

We need to decide not only what is important but what is **More** important and what is **less** important. We **evaluate** what we learned and create a backbone of ideas.
