I was inspired by [PARA Note System](PARA%20Note%20System.md) and [Zettelkasten Note System](Zettelkasten%20Note%20System.md).

Both offer great value but I have some issues with how they play with my notetaking style etc.

I mostly just adopted the Zettelkasten: atomic notes linked by relations. Thus I use *notes* and *extra* folders.

Some materials I want to store in the vault, while some are only links to web or even local files outside of the vault.

I do not currently store *fleeting* notes, cuz this is usually just on paper, not carried to the notes on the computer.

Now, I like the idea of taking ALL (or most) notes in the same app, thus I needed to adapt to PARA. 

I used *projects* folder, but I do not like the idea of separating **Projects** from **Areas**.

Finally, I have no archive: only status *done* in the metadata.

One big thing is that my *notes* folder has the feature of being converted into a blog, such that 

I can send those notes to a public url and share it with friends.
