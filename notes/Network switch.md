title: Network switch
---

A network switch is a [networking device](Network%20devices.md) that **connects devices together** on a computer network by using packet switching to forward data to its destination. It works at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model, and it is responsible for sending data only to the devices on the network that need to receive it. This allows the network to operate more efficiently and reduces the amount of traffic on the network.

A network switch typically **has multiple ports**, which can be **used to connect multiple devices** or other network switches **together**. When a device sends data to the network, the switch receives the data and uses the destination address in the packet to determine which port the data should be sent to. The switch then forwards the data to the appropriate port, where it can be received by the destination device.

In this way, a network switch acts as a central hub for network traffic, allowing devices on the network to communicate with each other efficiently and reliably. This is in contrast to a hub, which simply broadcasts data to all devices on the network, regardless of whether they need to receive it or not.
