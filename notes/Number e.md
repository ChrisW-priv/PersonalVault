Special case of [Exponential functions](Exponential%20functions.md). Also known as Euler Number.

number $e$ is a special number for which $\lim_{dx \rightarrow 0}\frac{e^{dx}-1}{dx} = 1$

also defined by [Exp(x) function](Exp(x)%20function.md) and $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{n})^n$

Often used in [Differential equations](Differential%20equations.md) where **rate of change (derivative) is proportional to the value at that point**

## Properties

1. Any number $n$ can be written as $e^{ln(n)}$ 
2. Derivative of $e^x = e^x$ 
3. Derivative $\frac{df}{dt}$ of $e^{cx}$ is equal to $c\cdot e^{cx}$ due to chain rule
4. Slope of a graph $y=e^x$ at any point $x$ is equal to $e^x$
