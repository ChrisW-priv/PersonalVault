OSI model was developed as a way to help disparate computing systems communicate with each other.

Most devices function at more than one level of the OSI model. When time comes to determine where they fit into the model, you must first determine the highest level at which they operate. To do that, you must know what they do.

Layers of OSI reference model:

1. [Physical](Network%20Layer%201%20devices.md)
2. Data link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application
