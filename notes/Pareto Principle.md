## Pareto Principle

Famous 20/80 rule.

> Out of 10 things you do, 8 do not contribute as much. Find and focus on 2 that matter most!

This rule is about applying the effort in a conscious way.

Constantly asking: "**where is my effort put to the best use**".

### $\text{Pareto}^2$

The 2 tasks that matter most are probably divisible into actions themselves. 

In that case, find the 20% of that task that matters most and execute on that.

- $\text{Pareto}^2$ leads to 4% of effort creating 64% of result.
- $\text{Pareto}^3$ leads to 1% of effort creating 50% of result.
- $\sqrt{\text{Pareto}}$ leads to 36% of effort creating 96% of result.
