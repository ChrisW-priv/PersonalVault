## Definition

Text of a message or information we want to send/preserve.

## Notation

To note consecutive letters/blocks in the plaintext we often use ${M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, \dots, M_{n}}$ 

## Intuition

Plaintext is often referred to as *message*.

In [Cryptography](Cryptography) plaintext is an original message that needs to be secured using [Encryption](Encryption.md).
