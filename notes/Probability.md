## Intuition

We can treat probability as an extension of Logic. In Logic we deal with values

like "true" or "false". Those are useful but often in life we are dealing with

some sort of uncertainty. To express this uncertainty we can use values between

0 and 1, where 0 means something is false (and so will not happen) and 1 means

something is always true (and will always happen).
