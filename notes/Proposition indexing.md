title: Proposition indexing
---

Proposition [Indexing](Indexing) is used in order to optimise 

[Retrieval of relevant documents](Retrieval%20of%20relevant%20documents.md).

Basically, we use [LLM](LLM.md) to summarise the entire document and then embed the

summary. After that we [embed](Embedding.md) the Original question and then

return entire document instead of document chunks.
