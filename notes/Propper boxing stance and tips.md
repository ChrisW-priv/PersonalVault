1. Never allow your feet to be close
2. Let there be a line between your legs (one leg pointing at one o'clock and the other at two o'clock). This allows better hip rotation
3. Always move on your toes, never heal-> toes, always toes first
4. Do not cross your feet when moving side to side, in general in any direction-> move the leg closer to the direction first
5. Hands straight, use body weight, make noise on the exhales + use feet
6. Keep your chin down, eyes up
7. Think defenceman in prep, do 1-2 slip, then counter, jab -> break
8. Hands up, after each punch, hands need to return to up position
9. Move your head! Each punch, each slip- make your head a *moving* target
