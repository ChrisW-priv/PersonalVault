title: Reflexive Relation
---

One of [Relation in Mathematics](Relation%20in%20Mathematics.md)

A relation will be known as reflexive relative if every element of set $A$ is related to itself.

### If the relation is reflexive:

If $aRa$ is satisfied $\forall a \in X$

### Example

$X = \mathbb{Z}, aRb \equiv a+b \in 2\mathbb{Z}$ is reflexive because $a+a = 2a$
