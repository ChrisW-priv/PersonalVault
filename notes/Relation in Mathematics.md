In discrete mathematics, the relation can be described as a collection of ordered pairs.

1. It is used to relate an object from one set to the other set, and the sets must be non-empty. 
2. Relation is always defined for set $X$.

### Notation (Example)

Relation of $a, b$ such that $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a + b$ is an even number would be written as: $X = \mathbb{Z},\ aRb \equiv a+b \in 2Z$
