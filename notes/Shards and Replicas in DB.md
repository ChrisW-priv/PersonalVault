Think of a _shard_ as just a slice of your overall dataset, stored on its own
server (or cluster node). Instead of one monolithic database that holds every
row from ID 1 to ID $\infty$, you have many smaller databasesâ€”each responsible
for only a subset of the rows.

Replicas are copies of the data (sharded or not) which allows better recovery
when one replica is unavailable as well as some parallel queries.
