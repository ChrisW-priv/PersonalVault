title: Sigma notation
---

Sigma notation is a shorthand notation for [Summation](Summation) of a sum that occurs with some pattern. It is commonly used with $\Sigma$ sign hence the name. Below the sign is number which starts the summation and above is the one that ends it (inclusive). 

## Example

"Sum all numbers from 1 to 10" would be

$$\sum_{1}^{10}n = 1 + 2 + \dots + 10$$

"Sum all positive numbers" is 

$$\sum_{1}^{\infty}n = 1+2+3+\dots$$

 > in markdown and latex instead of `/Sigma_1^{10}` we write it as `/sum_1^{10}`
