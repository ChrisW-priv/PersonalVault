## Definition

Stack is an insanely powerful [Data Structure](Data%20Structure). It operates on
basis of LIFO meaning that element that was pushed last will be used first.

## Associated Functions

- push - add element to stack
- pop - remove element from stack
- top - get value of the top element (without removing it)

## Intuition

Imagine stack as a drawer with documents. If you put some documents 'A,B,C,D' in
the drawer you can only take them out in 'D->C->B->A' order.
