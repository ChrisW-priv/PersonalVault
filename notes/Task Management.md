> Time management will only get you so far. Focus on Time Management.

You have to decide what action would have the **biggest impact**. 

Use [Eisenhower Matrix](Eisenhower%20Matrix) to prioritize and [Pareto Principle](Pareto%20Principle.md) to optimize.

Also remember: you are not only limited by time, but also focus, energy and skill.
