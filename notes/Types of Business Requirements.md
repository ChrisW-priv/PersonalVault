There is a simple taxonomy:

- Business requirements
- Stakeholder requirements
- Solution requirements [Functional vs Non-Functional requirements](Functional%20vs%20Non-Functional%20requirements.md)

Later sections describe what they do in detail.

See also: [How to create Business Requirements](How%20to%20create%20Business%20Requirements.md)

### Business Requirements

- describe the needs of the organization
- define WHY the change is needed
- define benefits for the organization
- focus on Business goals not solutions

### Stakeholders Requirements

- Define what goals or tasks are possible to realize
- Define WHAT users will be able to do with the system

### Solution Requirements

Those are split into: Functional and Non-functional requirements.
On the detailed diff: [Functional vs Non-Functional requirements](Functional%20vs%20Non-Functional%20requirements.md)
But a TL;DR:

- Functional requirements -> WHAT the system should do
- Non-Functional requirements -> HOW the system should perform
