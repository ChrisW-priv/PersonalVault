## Definition

Vector field is what you get when you associate each point in space with a [Vector](Vector.md).

We can treat this field as a [Function in Mathematics](Function%20in%20Mathematics.md) that uses $n$ variables (or 1 vector of $n^{th}$ degree) and returns a vector of degree $n$.

## Notation

We often don't graph vectors with their lengths but instead choose to represent magnitude of a vector with corresponding colour.

Often vector fields are not static! for instance wind could be represented as vector field and wind often comes in gusts.

## Intuition

We often can get a lot when we look at the vector field not by the lens of what it is supposed to represent but what it could represent. For example many properties like [Divergence](Divergence.md) and [Curl](Curl.md) can be understood graphically if we treat vector field as plane describing fluid motion.
