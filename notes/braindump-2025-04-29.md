I have  a thought: *is this ever gonna happen for me*

I have a lot of drive, a lot of ambition, i just have not yet hit my dream life,
and I only now realized how much pain I'll have to go through to actually get
it. Like, when you start a project you have this naive belief that things will
be ok, you can just do some small steps. and be good. but I just raised my head
and what I see scares me. I no longer have naive optimism to protect me. 

Some dude I listened to that has similar thoughts said *this just means you are
aware*. This is beautiful... but is a small consolation.

At some level I am for sure of taking action, and I think it is because I am
scared I will not make a perfect move. But that is a valid concern: how can I
keep pushing, if the actions I take can just me a productivity smoke and mirrors
of making a bad decision. I mean I tend to burry myself with work. such that I
no longer even think if I move in the right direction.
