So there is aider and claude code and stuff. 
But I want something way better. I want full mcp support for testing 
the assistant protocols as well as the freedom of the my own implementation:

- ANY AI provider I want to support
- More custom context management and the prompts

## Action Items

- [ ] Download, Setup and play around with the Claude code
- [ ] Learn how to do pretty CLI like aider/claude code
- [ ] Learn how to do MCP clients
- [ ] Build the thing
