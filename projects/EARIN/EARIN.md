## Action Items

- [ ] Prepare for the lecture on Wednesday
- [x] Make note on the alpha beta pruning
- [x] Make note on the constraints solver
- [x] Make note on the min max solver
- [x] Make note on the NP complete problems - what are they etc.
- [x] choose the project topic [due:: 2025-04-25]
- [ ] Attend Exam [scheduled:: 2025-06-13]
- [ ] Make notes on the Reinforcement Learning, and Markov Decisions Process
- [ ] Make notes on the logic inference and all the rules
    - What is the semantic versus syntactic
- [ ] There are diff types of learning
    - induction
    - abduction 
    - deduction
- [ ] Types of logic in AI (seems useful in context of building better RAG pipeline)
- [ ] researchgate and sciencedirect are two nets to fig. out 
- [ ] on 14th slide of comp. Vis there is a very important distinction on the types of the vision we can have


in a semantic we see if the word is true by looking at a truth table
in a syntactic way, we are applying the LOGIC to derive truth based on the predefined rules
