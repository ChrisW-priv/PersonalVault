I am thinking to implement graph theory algorithms in a sqllite3 compatible way. 

## Action Items

- [ ] define and implement types [important:: true] 
    - I'm thinking: relations as a-b pairs and nodes as generic relations of id-> other table row
- [ ] implement select algorithms [important:: true]
- [ ] define stable import/export on the thing [important:: true]

## Progress

Notes on what happened...

## Reflection

What went wrong? Why?
