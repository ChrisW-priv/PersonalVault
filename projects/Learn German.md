I Deleted Duolingo This Week

In just 7 days, ChatGPT taught me more English than I learned in 2 years on the app.

No streaks.
No cartoons.
No fluff.

Here’s the 6-prompt system that made learning feel like a superpower:

1. “Act like a language tutor. Guide me through a 2-minute everyday conversation — step by step.”
→ Conversations > vocab drills.

2. “Translate this sentence into English, quiz me on it 3 ways, and explain my mistakes.”
→ Feedback you actually remember.

3. “Simulate a coffee shop chat in London. Use slang and natural phrases, and push me to reply.”
→ Context builds confidence.

4. “Give me 10 modern phrases locals actually say — and explain when to use them.”
→ Fluent means sounding real, not formal.

5. “Build a 15-minute daily routine mixing speaking, listening, and writing.”
→ Consistency over cramming.

6. “Quiz me every 3 days on what I’ve learned — adapt to my weak spots.”
→ A system that grows with you.

Forget the streaks.
Learn the language.
Use it in the real world.
