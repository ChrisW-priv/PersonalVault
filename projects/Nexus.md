I want to make a nexus for all my notes, contacts and even shared clipboard.

## Action Items

- [x] Finish eng. thesis first
- [x] Make the PV repo private and work on a link to make it work with pulls from CI etc.
- [ ] Have a dedicated project on GCP again
- [ ] Create a clear def of what I want 
    - Would be really nice to have ONE overlay of ALL chats
