I desperately need a tool that will allow me to test some financial hypotheses.
This will allow me to familiarize myself with the consequences of my investments and stuff.

## Action Items

- [ ] Rewrite the thing to make simulation definition easy 
- [ ] Add easy options to add variables like curves and options etc.
- [ ] Need to make nicer option to add events with some offset
- [ ] Delete old events from que to make one off events not block entire queue
- [ ] Publish to the cloud to make ad-hoc access easy

## Progress

Notes on what happened...

## Reflection

What went wrong? Why?
