I read about markov chains. They seem to be exactly what we want here. He can deterministically say is we should bet or not.

There is an MDP or Markov Decision Process. Nice definition is on the lecture slides of [EARIN](EARIN.md)

## Action Items

- [ ] Find some materials on the poker evaluations
- [ ] make some simple loop of actions and states
