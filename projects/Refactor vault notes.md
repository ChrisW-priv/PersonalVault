Currently I have quite a few notes in the vault. But they well all written back when I when no idea how to learn. 

Thoughts:

- I want my notes indexable easily. Stable frontmatter + tags are key.
- Relations between the notes must be defined better. This is not Wikipedia such that each word that is present must be turned into a link. I'd rather have fewer links but of higher quality. 
- when I come back to a note after thousand years I need immediate feedback on what the concept is and how it relates to what I want to do.
    - title is the key word for concept I define 
    - description is some definition or short content summary 
    - examples of how to apply the concept 
    - feinman technique and general QA structure 

## Action Items
