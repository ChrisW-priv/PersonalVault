create an AI that uses robots to map space around a person and creates augmented reality to filter out information and allow for warnings like heat signatures that are in the area. 

In particular I'm thinking to produce the drones with "visible light" spectrum as well as heat cameras that will allow for both terrain mapping and the heat signature detection. 

I predict that turning the view from multiple drones into one space and then displaying it from users POV will be the hardest tasks to solve.
