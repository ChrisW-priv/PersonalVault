AI workflow is an extension of [[Project workflow]].
Steps you can follow for conducting AI research:

1.  Start by defining a clear research question or problem that you want to address. This will help you stay focused and ensure that your research is relevant and useful.
2.  Conduct a **thorough literature review** to familiarize yourself with the existing research in the field. This will help you understand the state of the art and identify potential gaps in the existing knowledge that your research can address.
3.  Once you have a good understanding of the existing research, develop a hypothesis or set of hypotheses that you want to test. This will provide a framework for your experiments and help you evaluate the results of your research.
4.  Next, design and conduct experiments to test your hypotheses. Make sure to carefully document your methods and results, and consider using appropriate statistical techniques to analyze your data.
5.  After conducting your experiments, analyze the results and draw conclusions based on the evidence you have collected. Be sure to carefully consider alternative explanations for your results, and consider replicating your experiments to verify your findings.
