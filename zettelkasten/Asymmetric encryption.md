# Asymmetric encryption
## Definition
It's a kind of [Encryption](Encryption.md) where it's practically impossible to know the [Decryption Key](Decryption%20Key) based on the [Encryption Key](Encryption%20Key). 

## Intuition
Also known as system with public key.
This system can remove need for trust and to keep secrets safe somehow (here to be able to share the Key). Real problem is to maintain accurate map of key-owner pairs in the system. Also we need to know to whom we are writing because we need his public key.
