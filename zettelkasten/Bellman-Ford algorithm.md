# Bellman-Ford algorithm
## Definition
Bellman-Ford algorithm is a Single Source Shortest Path ([[SSSP]]) algorithm for any [[Graph]]. It has much worse efficiency compared to other algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm. However, it can present correct result even with graph with negative cycles.
> [!Note] 
> This algorithm also can be used for detecting negative cycles and determine where they are.
