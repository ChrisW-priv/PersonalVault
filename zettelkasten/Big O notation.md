Big O notation is a tool we use to describe how the runtime of the algorithm changes as the size of the input changes. In big O we always skip any constants and scalars only take biggest factor in the total runtime equation. 

eg. 

$3n+1 \rightarrow O(n)$

$n^2 + n \rightarrow O(n^2)$

Often used with [Omega notation](Omega%20notation.md)
