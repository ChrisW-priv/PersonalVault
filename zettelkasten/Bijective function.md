Type of [[Function in Mathematics]]

Also known as one-to-one correspondence function.

Bijective function is a combination of [[Injective function]] and [[Surjective function]] (onto function). 

A function will be known as one-to-one correspondence function if every element of the domain set is connected with exactly one element of a co-domain set and vice versa. 

In the bijective function, from set A to set B, there is an inverse function from set B to set A. In the bijective function, every element of the set has a relation with itself.
