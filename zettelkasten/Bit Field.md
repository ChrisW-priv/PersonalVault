# Bit Field
## Definition
A bit field is a data structure that consists of one or more adjacent bits which have been allocated for specific purposes, so that any single bit or group of bits within the structure can be set or inspected.

Commonly used to represent [boolean](boolean). Very efficient for flags that define behaviour.
