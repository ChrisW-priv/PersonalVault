# Chain rule
> [!Definition]
> In calculus, the chain rule is a formula that expresses the [Derivative](Derivative.md) of the [Composed function](Composed%20function.md) `h` of two differentiable functions `f` and `g` in terms of the derivatives of `f` and `g` 

## Notation
For function $h$ defined as $h = f(g(x))$. 
$$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$$
## Intuition
There is a ton of good resources online that explain why this makes sense for now I leave it as #TODO  but see 3b1b video that explains it well.
