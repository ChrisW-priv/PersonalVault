## What is closure
Closure property is a statement that a certain operation on languages when applied to languages in a class (e.g. RE languages), produces a result that is also in that class

For regular languages we can use any representation to prove a closure property

## Union
If $L$ and $M$ are regular languages, so is $L \cup M$ 
$R|S$ is a regex whose language is $L \cup M$ 
## Intersection
If $L$ and $M$ are regular languages, so is $L \cap M$ 

## Difference
## Concatenation
If $RS$ are regex whose language is $LM$
## Kleene Closure
If $R^*$ are regex whose language is $L^*$
## Reversal
## Homomorphism
## Inverse Homomorphism
