# Comparing two hypothesis given data
## Definition
To compare two hypothesis, given data we have we can use [Proportional form of Bayes Rule](Proportional%20form%20of%20Bayes%20Rule.md). It is often the easiest way. We often split the equation into two parts: [Bayes Factor](Bayes%20Factor.md), and 
[A priori chance](A%20priori%20chance.md).

## Notation
$$\frac{P(H_1|D)}{P(H_2|D)}=\frac{P(H_1)\times P(D|H_1)}{P(H_2)\times P(D|H_2)}$$
## Intuition
Because if we compare how much better does hypothesis one explain data compared to hypothesis two then $\frac1{P(D)}$ can be simplified out the equation.
