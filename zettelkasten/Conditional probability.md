# Conditional probability
## Definition
Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) has already occurred.

## Notation
$$P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$
- $P(A\mid B)$ is a conditional probability: the probability of event $A$ occurring given that $B$ is true. It is also called the posterior probability of $A$ given $B$.
- $P(A\cap B)$ is a probability of both $A$ and $B$ occurring. 
- $P(B)$ is a probability of $B$ occurring
