Differential equations arise when it's easier to describe change rather that absolute amounts. For example system of 3 bodies in space pulled by gravitational forces is such system.

We divide systems of differential equations into:
- [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] (ODE) - finite number of values changing with time.  [[Examples of ODEs]]
- [[Partial Differential Equations]] (PDE) - deals with continuum of values (velocity of fluid in any given place or spread of heat in some physical body).  [[Examples of PDEs]]

## Higher order differential equations
We note equation of n-th order based on the higest order of derivative in the equation.
Example: $y'' - 6y' + 9y = 0$ is a second order differential equation.

## Solutions of differential equations
**General solution** of n-th order differential equation is a family of functions dependent on n constants.
**The particular solution** is a function which satisfies the differentail equation.
