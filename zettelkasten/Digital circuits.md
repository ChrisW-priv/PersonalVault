Digital circuits are [electronic circuit](electronic%20circuit) that use digital signals to represent and process information. [Digital signals](Digital%20signals) are [electrical signals](electrical%20signals) that can have only two [discrete](discrete) values, typically represented as [binary](binary) values of 0 and 1. Digital circuits use these binary values to encode and process information, allowing them to perform logical operations, store and manipulate data, and control other electronic devices.

Digital circuits are built using a variety of electronic components, such as transistors, [Logic Gates](Logic%20Gates.md), [Flip-Flops](Flip-Flops), and [Registers](Registers.md). These components are connected together in a specific arrangement, called a circuit, to perform the desired logical operations and processing of information.

The basic building block of a digital circuit is the logic gate, which is a simple electronic circuit that performs a specific logical operation on one or more input signals and produces an output signal based on the inputs. There are several different types of logic gates, each of which performs a different logical operation. For example, the AND gate produces an output of 1 only if all of its inputs are 1, while the OR gate produces an output of 1 if any of its inputs are 1.

Digital circuits can be designed to perform a wide range of functions, from simple logic operations to complex algorithms and computations. They are used in many different types of electronic devices, such as computers, smartphones, televisions, and appliances, to process and control the flow of information and the operation of the device.

Digital circuits are advantageous over analog circuits in many ways. They are more reliable, accurate, and precise than analog circuits, and can be more easily designed and implemented using computer-aided design (CAD) tools and automated manufacturing processes. They are also more flexible and scalable, and can be easily modified or updated to perform new or different functions.
