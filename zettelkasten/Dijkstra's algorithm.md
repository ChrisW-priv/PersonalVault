# Dijkstra's algorithm
## Definition
Dijkistra's algorithm is a solution to Single Source Shortest Path ([[SSSP]]) for non-negative [[Weighted Graph]]
Typically the efficieny of this algorithm is $O(E+log(V))$ which is really competetive against other algorithms.

## Notation

## Intuition
Dijkitra's algorithm can ONLY be run on graph with no negative edge weights. This allows us to let the algorithm act in a gready manner
