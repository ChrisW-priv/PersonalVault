# Eigenbasis
> [!Definition]
> Eigenbasis is a [Basis of vector space](Basis%20of%20vector%20space.md), where vectors defining the span are [eigenvectors](Eigenvector.md).

## Notation
As is with the "normal" change of basis matrix we write it as $$M = T^{-1}AT$$
Where $T$ is change of basis matrix and $A$ is original matrix
In case of the eigenbasis, $M$ is guaranteed to be diagonal, with it's [eigenvalues](Eigenvalue.md) on the diagonal
