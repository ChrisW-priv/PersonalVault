# Eigenbasis
> [!Definition]
> Eigenbasis is a [[Basis of vector space]], where vectors defining the span are [[Eigenvector|eigenvectors]].

## Notation
As is with the "normal" change of basis matrix we write it as $$M = T^{-1}AT$$
Where $T$ is change of basis matrix and $A$ is original matrix
In case of the eigenbasis, $M$ is guaranteed to be diagonal, with it's [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] on the diagonal
