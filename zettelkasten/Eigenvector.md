# Eigenvector
> [!Definition]
A nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that [[linear transformation]] is applied to it. The corresponding [[Eigenvalue]], often denoted by $\lambda$ , is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.

> [!Warning]
Not every linear transformation has eigenvectors or enough vectors to describe original system of coordinates fully!

## Notation
Every eigenvector must satisfy the equation:
$$A\cdot \vec{v} = \lambda \cdot \vec{v}$$
Where $A$ is a matrix describing transformation, $\vec{v}$ is an eigenvector and $\lambda$ is it's eigenvalue.

## Calculation
We start with the calculation of [[Eigenvalue#Calculation|eigenvalue]].
Then, we solve the [[System of linear equations]] for given data.
