# Encryption algorithm
## Definition
Set of instructions to turn [[Plain text]] into [[Ciphertext]]. It's behavior depends on the original message and special [[Encryption Key]], both of which constitute the input of the algorithm.

## Notation

## Intuition
If we have encryption algorithm there needs to exist some [[Decryption algorithm]] with it's [[Decryption Key]] to turn [[Ciphertext]] back into [[Plain text]].
