# Encryption algorithm
## Definition
Set of instructions to turn [Plain text](Plain%20text.md) into [Ciphertext](Ciphertext.md). It's behavior depends on the original message and special [Encryption Key](Encryption%20Key), both of which constitute the input of the algorithm.

## Notation

## Intuition
If we have encryption algorithm there needs to exist some [Decryption algorithm](Decryption%20algorithm) with it's [Decryption Key](Decryption%20Key) to turn [Ciphertext](Ciphertext.md) back into [Plain text](Plain%20text.md).
