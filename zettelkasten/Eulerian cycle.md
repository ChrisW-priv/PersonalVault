# Eulerian circuit
## Definition
An Eulerian circuit is an [[Eulerian Path]] which starts and ends on the same vertex.

## Notation
[[Counting the number of in and out edges in a graph]]

### Undirected Graph
Every vertex has an even degree

### Directed Graph
Every vertex has equal indegree and outdegree
