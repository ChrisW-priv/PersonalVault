A signal $x(t)$ is called periodic if there exists a number $T > 0$, called a period of the signal, such that for every time instant t the following equality holds
$$x(t+T)=x(t)$$
In the remaining part of this chapter, we assume that $T$ is a fundamental period, i.e., it is the smallest period of the given signal. If a series
$$X_{0} + X_{1m}\cos(\omega t + \phi_{1}) + X_{2m}\cos(2\omega t + \phi_{2}) + \dots$$
is pointwise convergent to $x(t)$ at every continuity point of x then it is called a Fourier series of signal $x$. 
If series above is the Fourier series of signal $x$, then its coefficients are given by following formulas
