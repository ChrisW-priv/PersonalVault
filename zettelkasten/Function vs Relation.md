The [[Relation in Mathematics]] and [[Function in Mathematics]] both are different concepts. 

All the functions are relations, but the relation cannot be function.

The relation and function have the main difference, i.e., **a relation is able to generate many outputs for at least one input**, but in the case of function, it can only generate one output for every input. This factor is very basic to differentiate between them.
