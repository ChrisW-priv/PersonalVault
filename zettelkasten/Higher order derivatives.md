## Higher order derivatives
Higher order derivatives are often referred to as "derivative of the derivative". Note: there is no limit to how "deep" we can go, however we will at some point hit either a point where consecutive derivatives form a loop. Sometimes that loop is one constant like 0 or $e^x$ but it can also be $sin(x)$.
### Notation
For an order of derivative $n$ of single input function $f$ we note it as $\frac{d^nf}{dx^n}(x)$.
