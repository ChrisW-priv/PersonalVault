One of [Relation in Mathematics](Relation%20in%20Mathematics.md)

Assume that there are two sets, set A and set B, and they have a relation from A to B. This relation will be described as $R \in A \times B$. The inverse relation will be obtained when we replace the first element of each pair with the second element in a set. The inverse relation is described as follows:

$R^{-1} = {(b, a) : (a, b) ∈ R}$
