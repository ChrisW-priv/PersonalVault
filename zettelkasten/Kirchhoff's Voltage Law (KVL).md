# Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
## Definition
The voltage drop between any two nodes does not depend on the oriented path along which it is computed.

## Intuition

Electric potentials (with respect to any point) of the circuit's nodes are well defined.
> [!Note] 
> The node with respect to which we measure electric potentials is called ground or earth.
