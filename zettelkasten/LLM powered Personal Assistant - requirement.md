## Requirements 

### Ability to easily extend, available knowledge and actions

AI assistant has to be able to adapt to new requirements. Whether it is new
skills that need to be acquired or new knowledge to be learned or Interface
change is required, there needs to be an easy way to accommodate this change. It
has to be accepted that the project will be continuously adapted to suit the
ever changing environment user is put in.

### No vendor lock-in

Vendor lock-in is unacceptable as the application serves to magnify human
creativity and speed. Thus, once operational, human with access to such
assistant would inevitably take on more responsibilities than normally possible.
In case of periodic unavailability of one provider, there HAS TO BE an easy
option to switch to other provider to allow continuous operation.

### Quality over Quantity

Ideally, we should trust the assistant to complete tasks independently of the 
human supervisor.
This can only be achieved if the tools that we connect to the LM are fully
tested as well as we verify that they are labeled sufficiently as to not bring
confusion between closely related tools.
