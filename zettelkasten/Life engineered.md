## What is this note about?

So I have a lot of techniques to optimize the processes I do. 
However, this means nothing if I have no real *strategy*.
I expect this to kind of mumbling journal of my thought on
the topic.

## Considerations

I guess, the first step I need to take is figure out what life 
I want, then work backwards from there... 

Features of life I want:

- Be fit
	- Endurance
	- Strength
- Build great software
- Have an ability to go skiing and travel
- Build a family where I can teach some next generation
- Have a house/flat in some center of Europe
