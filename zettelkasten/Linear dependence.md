A property of a [[Vector]]. 
Two vectors are linearly dependent if one sits at the [[Span of vector space|span]] of the other. 

Vectors that are linearly dependent are mutually redundant.

### Notation:
If $\vec{u}$ is dependent :
$$ \vec{u} = a * \vec{v} + b * \vec{w}$$
If $\vec{u}$ is independent :
$$ \vec{u} \neq a * \vec{v} + b * \vec{w}$$
