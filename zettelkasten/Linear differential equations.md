## Definition
Given a function:
$$y' + P(x)y = Q(x)$$
Step 1: Calculate an integrating factor
$$I(x) = e^{\int P(x)dx}$$
Step 2: calculate general solution
$$y = \frac1{I(x)}\left[\int Q(x)I(x)dx\right]$$

## Examples
Examples with no solutions attached are in [edde03](../UNI/y2/EDDE-DifferentialMaths/Lectures/edde03.pdf) in part 2
