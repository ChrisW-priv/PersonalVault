To set up MultiLinter for C++ and Python support in a project folder on Linux, you can follow these steps:

Install the Clang-Tidy and Pylint linters on your Linux system. You can do this by running the following commands:

```cmd

# Install Clang-Tidy
apt-get install clang-tidy

# Install Pylint
pip install pylint

# Install the MultiLinter tool by running the following command:
pip install multilinter
```

Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run the `multilinter` command to lint your code. You can specify the linters you want to use with the `-l` option, as in the following example:
```cmd
multilinter -l clang-tidy,pylint
```
This will run both Clang-Tidy and Pylint on your code and display any linting errors or warnings.

If you want to customize the options for each linter, you can create a configuration file for MultiLinter. For example, you can create a file named .multilinter.toml in your project folder, and add the following contents:
Copy code
[clang-tidy]
extra_args = ["-checks=*,-clang-analyzer-alpha.*"]

[pylint]
extra_args = ["--disable=W,C,R"]
This will configure Clang-Tidy to run all checks except for the alpha checks, and Pylint to disable certain warning and error messages.

You can then run the multilinter command again, and it will use the settings from your configuration file.
By following these steps, you can set up MultiLinter to lint your C++ and Python code in a project folder on Linux.
