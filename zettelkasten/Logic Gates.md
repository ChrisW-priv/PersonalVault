The basic building block of a digital circuit. Which is a simple [[Electronic circuit]] that performs a specific logical operation on one or more input signals and produces an output signal based on the inputs. There are several different types of logic gates, each of which performs a different logical operation. 

On the high level they can be treated as a special kind of [[Function in Mathematics]] operating on basis of [[Boolean Algebra]]. Logic gates are implementing [[boolean]] functions. Logic is done on [[binary]] input and results in binary output.

## Most common gates
[[XOR gate]]
[[NOR gate]]
[[NOT gate]]
[[NAND gate]]
[[AND gate]]
[[OR gate]]
