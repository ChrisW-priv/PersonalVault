A special kind of [[Function in Mathematics]] operating on basis of [[Boolean Algebra]].
Logic gates are physical devices (or sometimes their abstract representation) implementing boolean functions. Logic is done on binary input and results in binary output.
Note: tho we often refer to double or single input gates that have one result, in theory they can have any number inputs and outputs.

### Most common gates
[[XOR gate]]
[[NOR gate]]
[[NOT gate]]
[[NAND gate]]
[[AND gate]]
[[OR gate]]
