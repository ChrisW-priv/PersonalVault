# Logic circuits
ICs in short

## Definition
Logic circuits are electronic circuits processing two valued signals. Their operation is described by logic functions ([[Boolean Algebra]])

## Notation

### Elements
$x$ - element of a set (scalar or vector)
$X$ - set of elements x
$x_i$ - $i^{th}$ element ot the vector $x$ ($x = {x_1,x_2,...,x_i,...x_n}$)
$x^j$ - $j^{th}$ element of set $X$ 
$X^k$ - $k^{th}$ subset of $X$ 

### Symols
$\bumpeq$ - non-contradictory
$\equiv$ - equivalent
$\cong$ - pseudoequivalent
$\approxeq$ - compatible
$\approx$ - Moore pseudocompatible
$\sim$ - Mealy pseudocompatible



## Intuition
Basicaly logic circuits are systems of [[Logic Gates]] that are connected together in order to get specyfic output based on input. Therefore logic circuits are really [[Function in Mathematics]]
