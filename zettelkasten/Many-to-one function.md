Type of [Function in Mathematics](Function%20in%20Mathematics.md)

A function will be known as **many to one** function if **more than one element of a domain set is connected with the same element of a co-domain set**. 

That means a **single element of co-domain can have connection with more than one element of the domain**.

The many to one function always **contains repeated answers**.
