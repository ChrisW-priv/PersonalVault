## Relevance

We cannot learn efficiently without knowing the field scope or where is our goal
or what is important to get to that goal. We **need to do solid exploration**!

Actions:

1. Get diverse opinion from others
2. Learn theory (but do not get overloaded!)

Signs of progress:

1. Discovery of new variables
2. Irrelevant becomes relevant

## Awareness

Making conscious mistakes as fast as possible. You are getting better by becoming 
more aware of what is going on.

Actions:

1. Experimentation
	1. Trying to perform a skill
2. Reflection
	1. Thinking about why the mistakes were made
	2. Consider the variables
	3. Gather feedback

## Iteration

We are at this stage if we can perform the skill at least once or twice. Not
discovering new mistakes but having trouble with execution.

Actions:

1. Varied practice
	1. Different level of challenge, context, conditions
	2. Different subject, workload, medium, difficulty 
2. Adjustment

Signs of progress:

3. Better consistency
4. Execution is easier and becomes faster

## Lifelong

New skill becomes new habit
