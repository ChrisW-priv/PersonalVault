In computer science we use omega notation to check what is the minimum number of actions that need to be taken in order to perform some task. 
Often used with [Big O notation](Big%20O%20notation.md) to describe how algorithm performs now and what it could theoretically do.

Example:
addition has scale of $\Omega(n)$ because at least you have to calculate each digit
