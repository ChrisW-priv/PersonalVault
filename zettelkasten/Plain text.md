# Plain text
## Definition
Text of a message or information we want to send/preserve.

## Notation
To note consecutive letters/blocks in the plaintext we often use ${M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, \dots, M_{n}}$ 

## Intuition
Plaintext is often referred to as *message*.
In [[Cryptography]] plaintext is an original message that needs to be secured using [[Encryption]].
