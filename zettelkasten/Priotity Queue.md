# Priotity Queue
## Definition
Priority queue is a abstract data-type that has `priority` argument attached to every element. When dequeing elements we recieve them in either ascending or descending order depending on priority they were added in. In case of the same priority we ussually default ro regular [[Queue]] standard.

## Implementations
Most basic implementations often use [[Heap]] as a solution. Those work but are often quite inefficient (not as efficient as they could be).
