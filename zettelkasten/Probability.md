# Probability
## Definition
Probability measures how likely are some events to happen. It does so by assigning values between 0 and 1 where 0 means "will not happen" and 1 means "will allways happen".
All probabilities on a given set must be summed up to 1. If sum of probabilities is lower than 1 then we didn't count all possible states. If it's higher, we counted some events more than once.

## Notation
For an event $X$ we note it's probability as $P(X)$.
For an event opposite to $X$ we note it's probability as $1-P(X)$. 

## Intuition
We can treat probability as an extension of Logic. In Logic we deal with values like "true" or "false". Those are useful but often in life we are dealing with some sort of uncertainty. To express this uncertainty we can use values between 0 and 1, where 0 means something is false (and so will not happen) and 1 means something is always true (and will always happen).
