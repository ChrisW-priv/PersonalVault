General project workflow that involves multiple contributors:
1.  The project leader creates a project plan and assigns tasks to each contributor.
2. Leader also needs to establish means of communication, work documentation and versioning. 
3.  Each contributor is responsible for completing their assigned tasks according to the project plan.
4.  As contributors complete their tasks, they document their progress into a shared version control system.
5.  The project leader manages progress of team members and controls merges into the main branch of the project. He has to ensure that everyone is working off of the latest version.
6.  This process continues until all tasks are completed and the project is ready for final review and delivery.

Of all points point 3. is perhaps the most important. Ideally every team member should be easily replaceable based on the fact that his work status is clear and other people know exactly what to do and how.

Setup your project to follow what->why->how. This will make it clear to any new person what to expect and not be lost in a maze of your repo.
