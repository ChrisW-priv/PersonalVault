interesting idea against prompt engineering:

Prompt engineering is just a way to maximise the efectiveness of the

[LLM](zettelkasten/LLM.md). Often times, queries from user are short, inacurate, stripped of context.

Before passing the user query to the LLM, we could use some rules that will 

rewrite the query to one that will yield better result.

Common techniques:

Provide context to the query

"Explain reasoning first, answer at the end"

But also system prompts can be used to define behaviour.

Answering in a special way or providing policy to not answer on certain topics

or in special situations.
