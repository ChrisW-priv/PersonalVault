Pulay's algorithm is a method for accelerating the convergence of the [[self-consistent field (SCF)]] iteration in [[density functional theory (DFT)]] calculations. It was developed by Peter Pulay in 1980.

The basic idea behind Pulay's algorithm is to incorporate information from previous SCF iterations into the current iteration in order to improve the convergence rate. This is done by adding a correction term to the [[Fock matrix]], which is used to update the electronic density and the potential in each SCF iteration. The correction term is constructed from the difference between the electronic density from the current iteration and the density from the previous iteration.

Pulay's algorithm has been shown to be effective at speeding up the convergence of SCF iterations, especially for systems with a large number of electrons or for calculations using high-accuracy functionals. It is commonly used in conjunction with other methods for accelerating SCF convergence, such as direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS) and preconditioning techniques.
