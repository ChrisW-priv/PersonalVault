Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the properties of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are much faster than those performed by classical computers. Classical computers use bits, which are represented by either a 0 or a 1, to perform calculations. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent a 0, a 1, or both at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously, making them much faster and more powerful than classical computers.
