One of [[Relation in Mathematics]]

A relation will be known as reflexive relative if every element of set $A$ is related to itself.

### If the relation is reflexive:
If $aRa$ is satisfied $\forall a \in X$

### Example
$X = \mathbb{Z}, aRb \equiv a+b \in 2\mathbb{Z}$ is reflexive because $a+a = 2a$
