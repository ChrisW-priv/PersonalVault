To develop an app using [[Vulkan]], you will need the following:

1.  A computer with a supported operating system, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS.
2.  A [[graphics card]] that supports Vulkan, which can be checked by looking up the card's specifications online or using a tool such as GPU-Z.
3.  The Vulkan SDK, which includes the Vulkan runtime libraries, header files, and other tools necessary for developing Vulkan apps. The Vulkan SDK can be downloaded from the official Vulkan website.
4.  A supported development environment, such as Visual Studio or Eclipse, with the appropriate plugins or extensions for Vulkan development.
5.  Basic knowledge of [[graphics programming]] and the Vulkan API, including how to create a Vulkan instance, set up a logical device and command buffers, create pipelines and shaders, and submit commands to a queue.

Once you have all the necessary tools and knowledge, you can begin developing your Vulkan app by following the appropriate tutorials and guides. The official Vulkan website also provides detailed documentation and samples that can help you learn how to use the Vulkan API to create high-performance graphics applications.
