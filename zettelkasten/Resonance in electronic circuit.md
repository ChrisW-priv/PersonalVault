[electronic circuit](electronic%20circuit)

In AC circuits we may observe an interesting phenomenon called resonance. Actually, there are two definitions of resonance. The first defines a resonant pulsation of a one-port, which has impedance Z, as a pulsation ωr, for which the magnitude of impedance ∣Z∣ attains (as a function of pulsation) a strict local extremum (minimum or maximum). According to the other definition, a resonant pulsation of a one-port is a pulsation ωr, at which the impedance Z becomes purely real (i.e. it has non-zero imaginary part for pulsations belonging to a neighbourhood of ωr except for ωr, at which the imaginary part vanishes). A resonant frequency $f_r$ is related to resonant pulsation with equation ωr = 2πfr.
