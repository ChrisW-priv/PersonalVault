Type of [[Tree]] with designated [[root node]] where every edge either points away from or towards the root node. When edges point away from the root the graph is called an out-tree or in-tree otherwise.

Note: all out trees are also [[Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)]]
Note: although tree on it's own is undirected. Rooted tree is a DAG
