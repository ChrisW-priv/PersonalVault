[[Vector]] that defines space. 
Unit vectors are allways of length 1 and by [[Linear combination]] of them we can represent all vectors in space. 
Unit vectors should be [[Linear dependence|Linearly independent]] to maximise a [[Span of vector space]].

### Notation
For 2d it is customary to use $\vec{i}, \vec{j}$ for x and y axis respectively.
For higher dimensions we typicaly use $\vec{k}$, $\vec{l}$, $\vec{m}$, etc. 
It's also common to use $\hat{i}$, or $\hat{j}$ notation but  $\vec{i}, \vec{j}$ makes it obious it's a vector we are talking about and that is what we will use.
