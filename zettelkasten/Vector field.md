# Vector field
## Definition
Vector field is what you get when you associate each point in space with a [[Vector]].

We can treat this field as a [[Function in Mathematics]] that uses $n$ variables (or 1 vector of $n^{th}$ degree) and returns a vector of degree $n$.
## Notation
We often don't graph vectors with their lengths but instead choose to represent magnitude of a vector with corresponding colour.
Often vector fields are not static! for instance wind could be represented as vector field and wind often comes in gusts.

## Intuition
We often can get a lot when we look at the vector field not by the lens of what it is supposed to represent but what it could represent. For example many properties like [[Divergence]] and [[Curl]] can be understood graphically if we treat vector field as plane describing fluid motion.
