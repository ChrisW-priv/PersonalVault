## Ways of interpreting vector
Common way of interpreting the vector is to associate it with a force or movement in certain direction. Also it's common to associate it with a point in space.

1. In Physics we often visualize a vector with an arrow in space
2. In Computer Science we can represent vectors with an ordered list of numbers

Mathematics tries to generalize the idea of a vector and use it whenever it makes sense to use functions like addition or multiplication of vectors

Later on, in math it is common to treat vectors as a [matrix](matrix) of size $m \times 1$ where m is the number of dimensions a vector has and m is a number of columns a matrix would have.

## Notation
In 2d space: {x, y} or $\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$

In 3d space: {x, y, z} or $\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c\end{bmatrix}$
