# Worst case analysis in Cryptography
## Definition
In [Cryptography](Cryptography) we often analyse what happens and how secure the system is if the attacker has more and more information. This is divided into levels of knowledge (WC short for Worst Case):
- WC1: attacker knows the entire [Encryption System](Encryption%20System)
- WC2: attacker has [Ciphertext](Ciphertext.md)
- WC3: attacker has [Plain text](Plain%20text.md) match for the [Ciphertext](Ciphertext.md)
